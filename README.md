# blackhole

This is a simple Python script that scans a list of logfiles and looks for lines containing authentication failures and spam traps triggers. The script then extracts IP addresses from those lines and generates a [spamdyke](https://www.spamdyke.org) IP blacklist and install blackhole route for those addresses.

It is its initial version and I use it as way to learn and to practice Python.
